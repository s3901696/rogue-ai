										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Hi, I'm Dante Filatow</p>
									</header>
									<p>My life began when I was born in Warsaw, Poland on November 30th, 2002. I was mostly raised in the city of London, UK before moving to Melbourne, Australia when i was 6 years old. Since then, I've graduated high school and started my first year at RMIT University (2021). </p>
									<p>Accommodating me at home are; my parents, a younger brother, 2 dogs (Link and Twiggy), and 2 cats (Billy and Lotus). I mostly speak Polish to my family, to be fair though I often hear myself mixing the two languages together, and obviously other than that I speak English everywhere else. <p>
									<p>In my spare time I enjoy; gaming (mostly Rocket League and Assetto Corsa on my race simulator), trading cryptocurrencies (this is not financial advice), playing soccer (i prefer the term ‘football’, but whatever), karting (I love racing) and watching F1 and anime. A fun fact about me is that I can solve a 3 x 3 rubik’s cube in just over 50 seconds (my record: 52.52 seconds), however I average around 65 seconds.</p>

									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>The biggest leap forward towards my interest in IT is actually quite a weird story (for obvious reasons, I’ll try not to go into the specifics). During the pandemic, more specifically while lockdown in Victoria happened, I had the strange urge (with my passion for math and statistics) to create a spreadsheet and connected graph in Excel to map out data from the WHO (World Health Organisation). I enjoyed creating the formulas to automate the calculation process to make certain predictions, and was fascinated as well as interested by the resulting data. After things settled down in Victoria, I gained a newfound interest and curiosity in cryptocurrency. This gave me the opportunity to create another spreadsheet for my balances in crypto as well as my investments with gains/losses graphed and predictions for certain coins/NFT’s.
									</p>
									<p>My main interest in IT would be in the field of data science/data analysis and also programming, which I’ve always been wanting to learn. My current experience in IT would include; some basic knowledge of the Python programming language, which I learnt during the 2020 holidays, and an advanced understanding of Excel Spreadsheets. With the strong passion for IT which I have, I've chosen to come to RMIT because it was ranked as one of the top universities in the Information Technology sector, the convenience of location, and a great campus overall. At RMIT I expect to learn the basics of Python programming, understanding how to evaluate and design user interfaces that appeal to the user, being capable of designing databases for efficient data management in SQL programming, and lastly obtaining the ground knowledge in IT, to be able to apply it into software and job skills for the future.

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<p>The ideal job that would appeal to me would firstly be under the conditions it is remote work and via a contract. This is because I like the idea of being able to work for more than one company or industry, and being able to stay home while doing it.</p>

												<h4><a href="https://au.indeed.com/jobs?q=Data%20Science%2C%20R%20Programming%20%24148%2C000&remotejob=032b3046-06a3-4876-8dfd-474eb5e7ed11&vjk=a904489b7384d433">Security Analyst</a></h4>
												<p>As a Security Analyst, I would be required to create information management tools, and application of detection and recognition software to protect company assets, such as data, networks, and overall security.</p>
												<p>The reason that working as a Security Analyst appeals to me is mainly because it revolves around data analytics and program development which is one of the areas of IT I'm quite passionate and fascinated about. Secondly, it is a huge rising industry and includes a large daily paycheck, which I'll be honest is a major motivator towards working in IT. As a Security Analyst, it is required that I have 5 - 8 years of experience in the field of Data Science, strong technical skills, previous experience working with information management and cloud management systems. In addition to this, it is necessary to have a degree in IT, the ability to work with developers to automate systems, filling gaps in security.</p>
												<p>Currently, I don't have any of the experience required to apply for this job. As of now, I have gathered some work experience from the Bureau of Meteorology, spending some time experimenting with satellite weather prediction programs with the help of Professor John Le Marshall, a Senior Principal Research Scientist and a former winner of NASA’s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal. Additionally, I worked with Damian Agius, a Senior Systems Analyst from the Scientific Computing Services Department on detailed weather animations. Lastly, I was also able to experience how operations are run at the forecasting center and how task management is used to improve employee performance within the workplace. Other than this, I only have some basic knowledge of Python and HTML programming, as well as advanced computer/IT skills. I plan on gaining the skills necessary to be the perfect employee for the position of Security Analysis or something along the same lines as it. I will do this by initially completing my Bachelor of IT and possibly extending it to a Masters of IT in the future. After finishing my higher education to an above satisfactory level, I plan on signing multiple contacts as a Junior data scientist or analyst. After gaining 5 - 8 years of experience with a variety of companies in the field, I would begin looking into mid - higher-level positions in the IT industry such as; a Security Analyst, Data Scientist or Data Engineer. </p>

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>After completing the Myers-Briggs 16 personality test which finds which of the 16 personality types fit you best, and to gain a better understanding of how people are different (strengths/weaknesses). The results showed that I was a Turbulent Logistician (ISTJ-T). “A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.” After reading about what an ISTJ-T personality means, I agreed with the tests’ results as I believe they are a true representation and description of who I am as a person, and how I think and act on a day-to-day basis.</p>
									<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality"><img src="images/psnly.png" alt="Personality Type" style="width:486px;height:378px;margin-right:25px;"></a>
									<p>In addition to this, I completed an online learning style test which surveyed my basic technical and academic skills, ability to study independently, good organizational skills, and willingness to devote the same amount of time and effort as a face-to-face course. My overall score was 175,  which meant that I may need to; “acquire some new skills before proceeding with online courses, and also may need to increase your reading and writing skills, learn some time management skills, or take an introduction to computers course.” These results surprised me, as I believe I’m quite capable of learning through online courses and have no problem with learning with my current skill set. I’m set to believe that these results may not be an accurate reflection of my capabilities and skills.</p>
									<a href="images/learn.png"><img src="images/learn.png" alt="Online Learing Test" style="width:660px;height:200px;margin-right:25px;"></a>
									<p>Lastly, as my final test of my choosing, I completed the Moral Machine Test (self-driving car malfunction), which tested my judgments about difficult moral dilemmas that involve life or death situations. In my opinion, the results were mostly accurate and showed some truth to them. However, after completing the test more than once I found that often my results changed and were not as consistent as they should have been.</p>
									<a href="images/moral.png"><img src="images/moral.png" alt="Moral Machine Test" style="width:390px;height:377px;margin-right:25px;"></a>
									<p>Altogether the results from these three tests seem generally accurate and show somewhat meaningful results on my personality type, learning capabilities, and moral values. However, to me they are not of importance or significant value as the tests did not ask enough questions to result in supplying a reliable answer on my performance or personality. In order for such a questionnaire to be of any significance, they should conduct an interview personally and ask a larger variety of questions that could impact or affect my results in any way. Furthermore, asking the subject (me) for feedback based on the results of the test would also be of importance, especially if they believe the results do not correctly interpret or factor in their answers. This way, there would be less likely a chance of miscommunication or misunderstanding of the questions asked. 
I believe that the results from these will show a general idea of how I work in a team environment, and what strengths and weaknesses get exposed in collaborative-type projects. Beginning with the Myers-Briggs test, it informs me that in team-like scenarios I prefer to get things done myself rather than give responsibilities to others to handle. Furthermore, it mentions that I enjoy having a system to how things are done, a concrete set of rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. These traits certainly influence my behavior in a team by giving me the urge to bring organised structure, as well as clearly defined roles and responsibilities for my colleagues to undertake. Following this, the Online Learning test gave results that summarised that I’m a procrastinator, and am incapable of absorbing information through online learning, and struggle with being in team environments. These results display quite the contrary to the previous tests’ results, possibly because of how different the questions were from each other. Therefore, I am to believe that the results were incorrect and thereby my behaviour not being an influence in the team. The last test, the Moral Machine questionnaire, was a quiz on my moral values, and how I chose to make decisions. In a team scenario, this would influence the accountability, responsibility, and moral decision-making of a team. In a team, it is important that everyone shares similar morals or there are likely to be conflicts in the future. An example of this could be a team member wanting to take on extra responsibilities within the group. However, the other group members share different morals, believing that everyone should have an equal amount of responsibility. 
To take all of this into consideration when forming a group, it is important that all members of the group have skills or personality traits that complement rather than contradict each other, as well as sharing positive chemistry and working well together.</p>

									<h3>Project Idea: Vaptic Vest</h3>
									<p>In the vast field of Information Technology, there is a lot to be excited about. However, as a tech geek who is passionate about the future of gaming, I am constantly looking for new innovative technologies that take gaming to the next level. Particularly looking into Virtual and Augmented Reality becoming increasingly popular and standardized as the basis for interactive gameplay. The main inspiration behind the Haptic Vest is from the sci-fi movie Ready Player One, where the player wore a VR Haptic Feedback Suit which would allow them to operate your avatar/character, as well as feel what's happening to their body in the virtual world (also known as the ‘Oasis’). </p>
									<p>On the other hand, a Haptic Vest has much more potential than just simply being a piece of high-tech gaming equipment. A haptic vest could also have big applications in areas such as; therapeutics (particularly mental illnesses), emergency services (police, fire, ambulance), as well as military use. One example of the use of a haptic vest in therapeutics would be to give tight hugs (using the haptics of the vest) to relieve stress for people who suffer from anxiety or any other mental illness, which don’t have 24/7 access to a carer. In emergency circumstances, this vest would also be very practical in multiple instances. For medical purposes, the vest could monitor a person’s heart rate, fitness level, and body vitals, monitoring their health and wellbeing. Most importantly in the case where the heart stops beating, the vest could automatically use its haptic technology to conduct CPR without the use of a second person. In addition to this, if CPR isn’t sufficient to save the person, it could automatically use electrical pulses (built-in defibrillator) as a last resort to save their life.  A practical military-spec version of the vest could be used in the scenario someone is shot or stabbed in combat, the vest could detect the injury and seal around the wound (using the haptics and flexible polymeric self-repairing material) by applying pressure to the area affected, preventing further bleeding and loss of blood. </p>
									<p>To outline, the overall idea of the project is to create a simplified version of a ‘haptic-feedback vest’, with the capabilities of responding to computer inputs. To keep this project on a feasible level, the aim is to represent the vest with a piece of material stretched out over a square frame, with many small metal studs as well as fewer electromagnets spread over it. The electromagnets will be connected with wires to a small box (with Arduino), which communicates (most likely connected to pc) with the computers’ software program. The program, on a graphic level; will be a basic x by y, square graph of the mapped electromagnets, allowing the user to select and trigger (causing the voltage to run through the wires turning the selected electromagnets on) any area of the material to simulate the haptics of a compressing section of a ‘vest’. However, it is also possible to use Blynk to create an app on an iPhone/Android device which can communicate wirelessly to the Arduino to controller the electromagnets.</p>

											<li class="icon solid fa-book">Research & Development</li>
											<li class="icon solid fa-bolt">Electronic components</li>
											<li class="icon solid fa-users">Solid Teamwork</li>
										</ul>
									<p>In order for this project to produce a tangible product, there will be some basic software and hardware skills needed. To begin with, there will have to be some fundamental software skills needed to create a program (using Arduinos’ CC+ ‘language’ or Blynk) that can trigger selected electromagnets at a safe voltage (1.5 - 2 volts in parallel). In the case this may be troublesome, parts of the code may be sourced from existing GitHub repositories. Furthermore, there is quite a lot of hardware involved with the project as well as some skills with electronics. Hardware needed includes; a computer/tablet  /phone, many tiny magnetic metal studs, a few electromagnets, Arduino, relay module, I/O pins, wires, some piece of polymer material, and possibly some more electronics. Moreover, putting the hardware together will also require some skills in electric circuits. I believe that this project isn’t beyond what is feasible and with some extended research and development behind a solid team, the simplified concept of a ‘haptic vest’ is possible to engineer. The hardware isn’t expensive or rare and is easy to attain, as well as the software is not difficult to learn and integrate into the hardware after some experimenting with it. </p>
									<p>With the overarching goal of creating a basic idea of a simple functioning ‘haptic vest’, there may be some potential drawbacks or obstacles to encounter along the way. With software as well as many hardware components communicating with each other, there are bound to be issues and problems with the limited understanding of how a ‘haptic vest’ should operate. Considering the fact that I could not find a ‘haptic vest’ that functions similarly to the one thought out in this project, is a concerning factor to this ‘innovation’. Drawbacks in the project could be from factors such as; code, electrical connections, voltage distribution, or any other piece of hardware integrated into this ‘haptic vest’ that I may understand.</p>
									<p>On the other hand, if the project is successful it could potentially prove or inspire the idea of integrating more advanced electromagnetic technology into vests for gaming, therapeutic, medical, or even military use. By being able to equip the disabled or mentally ill with a vest that could monitor their health state and perform CPR in case of emergency, the carer does not need to worry if they must leave their patient for a short time, as they can stay assured that the vest is keeping them safe and supported. The success of this project could also lead to saving the lives of those who are in the military and could potentially be injured in combat and are in need of instant pressure to a puncture in their upper body area so that they don’t lose blood. Lastly, for gamers who want to be immersed in their VR game to the fullest extent, by wearing an advanced version of the ‘haptic vest’ they could feel the sense of touch, in the virtual world. This could be things like; ‘vibrations’ from an in-game shock wave from an explosion, a ‘tap’ on the shoulder from an in-game character, or the ‘tingle’ of an in-game bug walking on your back. Whichever way the high-tech version of the ‘haptic vest’ is used, it will innovate and move forward the tech industry in more ways than one.</p>
